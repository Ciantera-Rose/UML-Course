High level overview of each of the major types of diagrams that are offered by UML

-Two Categories: 
    *Part One: Structrual Diagrams
    *Part Two: Behavioral Diagrams

Part One:
    -Structural diagrams:
        -Are any type of diagrams that model the way a system is architected.
        -A class diagram is one of the most popular structural diagrams out there. 
        -It's a way of defining the different class names, attributes, and method 
        names that belong inside of a system that you're building.

        -CLASS: 
            Pick out what type of data you want, how you want those elements 
            to be associated with each other, and some of the core operations.
                *Name
                *Attributes
                *Operations

        -DEPLOYMENT:
            Gives us the ability to model how an entire system architecture should be configured.
            If we have an application that has multiple servers, multiple places where we can store 
            code and it's going to communicate with the system, a deployment diagram is perfect for 
            setting that up. ie. Deployment engine for stages of production
            Made up of six components:
                *Nodes 
                *Components
                *Artifacts
                *Links
                *Dependencies
                *Associations

        -PACKAGE:
            Great to use for code libraries you want to build an application with.
                *Classifer
                *Class
                *Use Case
                *Type
                *Component
                *Package
                *Constraint
                *Dependency
                *Event
