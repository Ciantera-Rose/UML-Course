**Overview of UML Use Case Diagram Elements**

        -Use Case Diagrams:
            One of the reasons you build this type of diagram is to set up the authorization rules and to illustrate what 
            types of features certain individuals or an API client is going to have access to.

        -The four main elements that are:
            *Use Cases
            *Actors
            *Subsystems
            *Relationships.

            -Use Cases:
                *Represented by a circle
                *Typically have some type of action
                *Illustrates what types of actions and functionalities that an actor has access to.
                *The goal is to pass off to a developer with it being clear on how to build an
                 authorization engine for what each user has access to.

            -Actors:
                *May be a human or an API/Software client etc
                *Actors will have access to the system

            -Subsystems:
                *Subsystems are represented by large rectangular boxes that have use cases and different elements inside of them. 
                -ie>
                *Get reports
                *Get message
                *Manage contacts
                *Visit resources
                *Forms
                *All inside of this web dashboard element.
                *Subsystems (also called system boundaries) are different elements that you can place inside of a use case 
                 diagram to help you organize and see where these types of use cases are actually going to occur.

            -Relationships:
                *Relationships are represented by dotted lines with open arrows.        
                *Shows how you can go from one use case to another.
                *This gives you the ability to connect your actors directly to the use cases 
                 and the elements and actions that they have access to in the system.
