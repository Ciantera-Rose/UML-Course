# UML-Course
UML is an acronym, it stands for Unified Modeling Language.
Provides visual models of how a system is going to interact.
-User behavior
-What the system does
-Tool for problem solving, being able to visualize your code.

Stages of Development where UML is Utilized:
    Activiy Diagram: 
        Allows you to say what happens at each stage of an application's flow. 
        It's a way of being able to break down the flow of an application into v
        ery small manageable chunks.

    Deployment Diagram:
        Gives you the ability to take an incredibly high-level look at your code.
        You can say that I want to have a front end MVC be a Javascript-Angular type 
        of application and I want an API that performs certain tasks and I also want 
        to have a database server along with specific types of elements configured on it.
         You could build out your entire architecture that way.

    Class Diagram:
        During development, you can use Class Diagrams to help you model your entire 
        database to see the relationships between tables and to ensure that you're performing 
        best practices such as database normalization, etc. if you build it prior to building 
        the entire system, you'll find that you're going to have a much more organized approach 
        to modeling your databases.

    Use Case Diagram:
        Use Case Diagrams are very high level and allow you to organize each of the processes 
        a specific user of the system is allowed to access. When I'm building an authorization 
        system I can check to see the different features that users or that type of user should 
        have access to. By utilizing a Use Case Diagram, it allows me to take a visual approach.
        It also is something I can use to show non-technical stakeholders to ensure that I'm 
        building the system in the right way.

    Sequence Diagram:
        Lastly, after the entire application has been built, UML can still play a very helpful role. 
        For example: if I have to build in a more advanced feature or refactor something that was built 
        awhile ago, I can use what's called a Sequence Diagram. Sequence Diagrams are able to see all of
        the messages the system is passing internally to ensure that I'm building my methods in an efficient 
        way and I'm following best practices so I can implement something that'll actually work in the system.

    Package Diagram:
        After the entire system has been built, there are times where I personally go look at the 
        code base and see how I can organize it be more efficient or I want to decrease the coupling 
        between different modules. I may take out one part of the entire application and turn it into 
        an outside code library. To do that, I can use a Package Diagram to see how I'm organizing the
        entire code base. That also gives me a very high-level overview for every component in the 
        system and allows me to make sure that I'm conforming to best practices. If I bring a new member
        to the team, I can show them that Package Diagram and they'll be able to see how the entire system
        is organized.
