**Overview of the Elements of a UML Sequence Diagram**

    -UML Sequence Diagrams:
        -Especially popular as you get into more advanced development
        -Implementing design patterns
        -Dissect the activities or the data and the relationships
        -Allows you to visualize all of the messages that are being passed 
         between the various components of your system
        -Pick, choose and isolate all of the elements and see how they 
         should communicate with each other


    -Elements that make up a sequence diagram are;
        *Class Roles or Participants
        *Activation or Execution Occurrences
        *Messages
        *Lifelines.

    -Class Rules or Participants:
        *May be named either or depending on the software
        *The participant/class rules
        *What the participant is in charge of

    -Activation or Execution Occurrences:
        *The event when something transpires, when it sends or receives a message
        *Will need something to manage that communication
        
    -Messages:
        *Represent by lines with arrows in the direction the message is being sent
        *A method that has the ability to take in some kind of input, send 
         output and in some cases it can receive output back.
    
    -Lifelines:
        *Dotted lines that go from the participant all the way down for the 
         entire diagram. 
         *They make it easier for us to see each one of the stages and to give 
          a spot where the messages can be sent. 
         *They don't actually do anything, they're more there so we can know 
          at what stage a message is going to be sent to one of the participants and so on and so forth.
