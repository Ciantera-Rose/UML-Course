 **Overview of UML Package Diagram Elements**

        -UML Package Diagrams: 
            *Package diagrams at a high level are simply ways of wrapping some of the other components 
             from other diagrams and what they represent.
            *They carry a number of abstract elements:
                -Types   
                -Classifiers

        -Concrete elements that have made up other diagrams have already gone through like;
            *Class
            *Use Case
            *Component
            *Package
            *Dependency
            *Event

        -Package diagram:
            *Allows you to take your other different components inside of your system and show how 
             they relate to each other 
            *Show dependencies and some different elements like that. 
            *Some type of third party library, to show where the dependencies are and how each one of 
             the modules relates to each other.
            *Represents the structure of your software at a very high level and shows how it can 
             be composed and also how each one of the elements is interconnected.
